kiio-podcast is a [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) bundle. 
It works with NodeCG versions which satisfy this [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning) range: `1.0.0`
You will need to have an appropriate version of NodeCG installed to use it.
It's used to track voice members in the configured Voice channels of your discord server while also tracking the current voice status (speaking/silent).

In combination with the included Polymer element "discord-voice" one can display the discord voice members in a nice and customizable way, making it way more versatile than the Streamkit solution provided by Discord themselves.
